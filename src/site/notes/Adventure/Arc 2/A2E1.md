After waking at their new base of operations and enjoying a sausage breakfast, the party decided to spend the day at Duke Atkins' Circus of Eternity. There they found [[Player Characters/Toki Kalltskägg\|Toki Kalltskägg]], the Dwarven Hurdy-Gurdist from the now disbanded [[NPCs/The Nine Inch Flails\|The Nine Inch Flails]], looking for new work. The party invited him to join them, at least for the time being. After shooting a very expensive lute, and attempting to sneak into a 2 copper admission event, they secured front row tickets. Shortly into the animal handling part of the performance, however, a masked individual assassinated the beast handler and freed the 2 owlbears, while 2 armed men blocked the exits, encouraging those fleeing to kill each other to escape. Though the assassin escaped, the party shut down the threats between their skills, the help of the crownsguard, and airbourne pocket sausages. On the bodies they found a distinctive ring with a lion symbol. The party returned to their home for an early night.
