Made way to [[Locations/West/Dogtide\|Dogtide]] to attempt to learn more about the individuals behind the unusual gems. Encountered [[NPCs/Bayford\|Bayford]] in [[Locations/West/The Foamy Crossbow\|The Foamy Crossbow]] and asked him to help get them in touch with underground contacts. Peter met with [[NPCs/Garret & Ean\|Garret & Ean]] to put forwards a patent idea for a Foon. Met with [[NPCs/Wren\|Wren]], learnt he had also received gems from Destrian that broke about the same time as Veris'. Encounter got tense, Peter threw Barley at Wren. The party fled through the window as reinforcements arrived, which was unlocked by Bayford with some apparent glint of magic. Bayford got away from both parties, and the group retreated to the tavern, with Barley swiftly knocking himself out on their strongest rum. While planning their next move, [[NPCs/Fizzcheek\|Fizzcheek]] began playing with the Tuning Fork, which activated after a minute of ringing it. The party were transported to a gem filled cave, containing mining equipment and battered bodies. As they stepped forward to investigate, a huge chitinous creature burst out from the rock, lunging at Veris.
