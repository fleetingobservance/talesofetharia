Crossed the Rocking River with some effort, and travelled to Avicrest. Disguised Fizzcheek as Barley's reclusive brother. After getting the lay of the land, travelled to the Blue Moon District. Barley opened an account at the Epitoma, then travelled to the Order of the Gauntlet. Barley convinced Nordurk he has promise as a Paladin, who tasked him to research the 3 central oaths. Bought fish and pants at the market.
