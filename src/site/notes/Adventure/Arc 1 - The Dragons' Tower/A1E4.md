Handed [[NPCs/Bayford\|Bayford]] over to the guardhouse, was promised a bounty post-trial. Noticed a look of confidence in the thief. Encountered a trader in [[Locations/West/The Snoring Orc\|The Snoring Orc]] who had been ambushed by Bugbears, north of [[Locations/West/Whitebridge\|Whitebridge]]. Stayed overnight, travelled North to Whitebridge in the morning. Played Arrow Chicken, Hammer Chicken, and Knife Chicken en route. Rested in The Little Maple Inn, where Veris' gem broke into dust and shards. Bought an urn from golom craft to keep the dust in. Tracked the Bugbears north, and were caught in a surprise ambush. The Wolf from peters exile joined the fight, beheading ensued. [[NPCs/Fizzcheek\|Fizzcheek]] was knocked out, almost dying before being brought back by Barley. Found a magic sword, damaged, with a shooting star symbol on the hilt.
