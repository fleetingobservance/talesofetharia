Tracked bugbear camp, rescued Tordor the Trader, learned the Bugbears found the magic sword lying around. Acquired crates in [[Locations/West/Whitebridge\|Whitebridge]], and made plans for the gem exchange. Agreed that once the exchange business is completed, [[NPCs/Fizzcheek\|Fizzcheek]] would be given the choice to stay with the party or take his freedom. Located the exchange point and set an ambush. Much slaughter ensued from the party and Fizzcheek. Found on Destrian's body a light blue Tuning Fork, and a journal discussing the mining of the gems, suggesting another "world". Tracked the footprints to find they appeared suddenly in a field.
