Ate at [[Locations/West/The Snoring Orc\|The Snoring Orc]], destroyed some locals in a drinking competition to the music of [[NPCs/The Nine Inch Flails\|The Nine Inch Flails]]. Destroyed the toilet. Had the gems appraised, discovered they are not magical, and sold one for 250gp. Purchased new weapons, armour and equipment. Peter visited Asnah, head of geology at Dalry University, discussed rumours of glowing gems from other planes. Heard of unusual burglaries, investigated then intercepted the thief at Avicrest Brewery. Gave chase, caught him, learned his abilities came from boots that were left neatly outside his home.
