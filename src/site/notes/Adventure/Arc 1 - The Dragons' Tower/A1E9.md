Seir, who demonstrated some skill with magic, was able to restore Peter. Veris bargained with Peter over a harvested Basilisk eye and spine. They pushed on and finished their journey through the Badlands, and after taking a short rest, began the climb up [[Locations/North/Greyscale Peak\|Greyscale Peak]]. Peter found and collected some Cinderpetals. Just beyond the summit the found the ancient tower they had been searching for. Barley noticed it seemed to have a magical aura to it. Inside they found Kobold corpses that had fallen prey to magical traps. On the 1st floor the party destroyed a small tribe of Kobolds.
