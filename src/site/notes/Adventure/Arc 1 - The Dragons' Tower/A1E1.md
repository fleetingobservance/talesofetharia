An unlikely party formed at The Lucky Goose in Dimhill for a quest to put down some "Dirty Thieving Goblins". They discovered the post did not originally include the requirement for a party. They tracked the Goblins north-west, crossing the Rocking River on their way. After destroying a small camp, one goblin escaping, they followed it to an ancient fissure where they were operating from. After defeating the rats and the Goblin Boss, the last goblin standing, Fizzcheek, surrendered to the party. The party recovered unusual and valuable gems, and learned they were being traded from a mysterious individual in exchange for mining equipment. They led their captive and the recovered equipment out of the cave, making plans to have Fizzcheek complete the exchange.
