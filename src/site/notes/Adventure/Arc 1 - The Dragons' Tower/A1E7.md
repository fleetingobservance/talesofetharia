Killed the creature in a difficult fight. Found one man still alive, Turth, a member of the local council in [[Locations/West/Dogtide\|Dogtide]]. Learnt the cave sits in a pocket dimension. Returned to Dogtide. Examined the Foon prototypes, gave one to [[NPCs/Fizzcheek\|Fizzcheek]]. Fizzcheek left the party to stay in Dogtide. The party set off for [[Locations/West/Avicrest\|Avicrest]], killing a Dire Wolf and saving Peters wolf on the way. Made an enemy of Tailan on refusing to reimburse him for the broken gem. Found arrow chicken on the front page of Avicrest Herald. Barley took his oaths, [[NPCs/Nordurk Crestmaul\|Nordurk Crestmaul]] fuming at the news he had sold his holy armour. Peter and Veris recieved a message that Rubredd had been murdered, and Bertie had requested them in [[Locations/Central/Dimhill\|Dimhill]] to solve the case. Stayed at the Snoring Orc.
