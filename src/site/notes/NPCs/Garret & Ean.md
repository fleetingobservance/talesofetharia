Old Male Gnome Gnome and his pet crab, who owns and runs [[Locations/West/Garret's Workshop\|Garret's Workshop]] in [[Locations/West/Dogtide\|Dogtide]]. Garret is an inventor who specializes in explosives and unusual metalwork. Ean inexplicably wears a top hat, tips it with a well practiced "m'lady" on command, and seems to do Garret's taxes.

Garret has a joint venture with [[Player Characters/Peter\|Peter]] designing and distributing Foons.
