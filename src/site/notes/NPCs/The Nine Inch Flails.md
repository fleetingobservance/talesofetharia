A now disbanded group of bards that travelled the land bringing a strangely powerful form of Alternative Music to Taverns everywhere.

Members:

**Orilo "Lungful" Kolae-Gileana**
A male Goliath is a rare enough sight in these lands, let alone one often seen blasting the contents of his lungs through bagpipes larger than many men. The power of his "music" is a terrifying thing.

**Tyna Stoutman**
A small female Halfling who plays beautiful Lutes she crafted herself. Despite her tiny frame and tinier instruments, their incredible craftsmanship means she can easily keep up with the louder members of the group.

**Rhivaun Mristar**
A human male with a sickly complexion. He uses strange instruments that appear to be of Gnomish Tinkering, like an odd metal harp, and he acts as the band leader, directing the members through the set while adding all manner of percussive and ambient sounds.

**[[Player Characters/Toki Kalltskägg\|Toki Kalltskägg]]**
A male Dwarf with a short beard and Runic Tattoos on his arms. He uses his magical prowess to play a drum with a floating Mage Hand while he riffs on his signature Hurdy-Gurdy.
