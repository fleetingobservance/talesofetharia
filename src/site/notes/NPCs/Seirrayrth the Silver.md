A young silver dragon who is allied to the Friday Knights. He uses a powerful Frost Breath attack, and is capable of polymorphing into a human-like form that is strong with spell and sword.

He vetted the parties capability by scattering magic items from his hoard to be picked up by low level nae-do-wells, giving the party threats to neutralize. He then enlisted their help to kill an Evil Dragon, [[NPCs/Dysinneth the Red\|Dysinneth the Red]], who had taken over his lair at the top of an ancient wizards tower on [[Locations/North/Greyscale Peak\|Greyscale Peak]]. On defeating Dysinneth, Seir gifted the party a portion of his hoard, and a house in Avicrest. Concerned with the movement of dark forces, he asked the party to entreat with kingdoms on his behalf, and offer aid.

He now resides at his lair, pouring through the ancient tomes in search of answers to the mysterious past and the concerning present.
