A down on his luck Human male from [[Locations/West/Avicrest\|Avicrest]] who found some success in petty thievery until caught by the Friday Knights in an epic rooftop chase across the Spine. Some of his success was attributed to the **Boots of Striding and Springing** he received indirectly from [[NPCs/Seirrayrth the Silver\|Seirrayrth the Silver]].

Having somehow escaped from Avicrest, his last known location is [[Locations/West/Dogtide\|Dogtide]], where the party enlisted his help to find contacts.
