*Hill Dwarf Barbarian, Totem of the Wolf*
Exiled from his mining colony [[Locations/Central/Lowridge\|Lowridge]] for a crime he did not commit, murdering his family, he roamed the wilds for years. He shared a meaningful friendship with a Wolf while in the wilderness while working as a freelance bounty hunter. He keeps an open mind to different races, but is still prone to frightful fits of rage. He hopes to one day clear his name, if just to move on from the heavy veil of false accusation.

Recently he encountered a Doppelganger that was intent on framing him for all manner of terrible crimes. While he was able to interrogate and end this imposter, he learned of the mastermind behind this, "the Lord of [[Locations/North/The Iron Mountain\|The Iron Mountain]]".
