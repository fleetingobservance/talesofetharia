*Mountain-Dwarven Bard of Knowledge*
Toki met the party while playing for the Nine Inch Flails. Now they have disbanded, he has joined the party full time, looking for material to inspire his next alternative project.

Though he does not often talk about his past, he seems to draw on a strange innate power using his voice that allows him to propel the world around him.
