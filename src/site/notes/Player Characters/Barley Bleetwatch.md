*Lightfoot Halfling Paladin of the Ancients*
A humble Shepherd who inadvertently stumbled across an epic battle between light and dark, and as the dust cleared, wrongly received a Celestial Blessing evidently intended for the now vanquished Hero. On returning to his town, he was immediately recognised the chosen Holy Warrior, given the vestments and arms of the legendary Sankari, Yarlos the Hopeful, and ushered on his way to The Order of the Gauntlet in Avicrest, having no idea what just happened.
