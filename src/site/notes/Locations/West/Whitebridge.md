A town of crafters that thrives from it's close proximity to [[Locations/West/Avicrest\|Avicrest]] and the freshness of the Rocking River that flows through it. It boasts a well maintained stone bridge with painted wooden ornate railings that crosses the river from South to North. Whitebridge specialises in river fishing and textile craft.
