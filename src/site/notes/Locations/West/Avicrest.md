Avicrest is the Capital City of the Western Kingdoms of Man in Etharia, currently ruled by King Telipinus Eudoxia. The city is divided in 4 primary regions.

*The Strata*
Found here is the Palace, and many of the noble manors. Commoners can freely approach the royal court for judgement on their matters.

*Founder's Square*
Centre for trade. Houses a busy market, artisans, and bureaucrats, as well as public organisations such as The Fighters Guild, and The Venators.

*The Blue Moon District*
Home to universities, libraries, magical scholarships and all manner of learning. Also less public organisations, such as The Order of the Gauntlet.

*The Spine*
The majority of the city's Residential land. Named for the arching main street that houses most of the middle class, while the slums of the city point off like ribs.
