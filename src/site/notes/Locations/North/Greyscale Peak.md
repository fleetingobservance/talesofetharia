A Mountain in The Cloistered Tops north east of the West Etharian Kingdom, above [[Locations/Central/The Badlands\|The Badlands]]. Apparently belonged to a wizard in ancient times, and contains many of his book. Currently acts as the lair/base of [[NPCs/Seirrayrth the Silver\|Seirrayrth the Silver]]. Was forcibly occupied by [[NPCs/Dysinneth the Red\|Dysinneth the Red]] until the Fridays Knights helped Seir defeat him.
