Scholars have long speculated about the nature and quantity of Realms apart from our own. Some are known to us, such as The Radiant Land, from which we borrow our sunlight and Paladins borrow their purpose. The elements making up the world we know, Water/Fire/Earth/Air, are known to have their own sources which surround and feed us. But there have been unsubstantiated rumours of "Echoes", things that are of our world but yet are not. These reports usually speak of colours either being remarkably vibrant, or disturbingly washed out, as well as sightings of unfamiliar creatures. I hypothesize realms exist much closer to home than we believed, and I propose a formal study be conducted. *- internal paper from Professor Asnah of Dalry University**
