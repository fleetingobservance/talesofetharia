From the heart of Avicrest, which in turn is the beating heart of Western Civilization, King Telipinus EudoxiaÂ rules over his people. Avicrest is a new city by any standard, and his Great Grandfather Asterios was the first to claim title of King, around 100 years ago. Asterios Eudoxia was the one to unite the scattered peoples, and rise against the threat of the invading Orcish tribes, led by Gorgo the Blighted. The battles were fierce, but man triumphed over Orc, driving them back to their Southern Strongholds. With the treasure they plundered from their victory, they set about building their tall walls, and declared the Western Kingdom of Etharia to be under the protection of Avicrest, the New City.
