Mythology through the cultures in Etharia differs wildly, as should be expected. Many have observed, though, some common threads through them. One such thread is regarding the dramatic appearance of certain landscapes. The stunningly jagged coastal cliffs in some areas, battered far beyond simple erosion, have led the minds of many to imagine great beasts hurling themselves at Etharia from the sea. Some imagine the Great Eastern Mountain Zarata to have been pushed aloft by a mighty man underground. While only the superstitious continue in these beliefs today, researchers have been unable to determine a decent explanation. - *exert from Myths of the Realm by Judeil Rhassi*
